## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Time overrun | High | Scope strictly to MVP; use templates |
| LLM accuracy issues | Medium | Fallback to text input; pre-train on dataset |
| Base network congestion | Medium | Use local Ganache for fallback |
| High API costs | Low | Use free tiers; monitor usage |
| Key team member unavailable | High | Pair programming; document everything |
